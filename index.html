                    <span>For over a decade, one of the most requested features from members of the community is a way to hover over a member for a quick snapshot of their profile (like Facebook and Twitter) before having to click over to someone&#x27;s profile.  Not only does it save time, but it also helps you connect with only those other members who share your interests in surveying, geography or experience.   This new feature can come in handy when looking for someone who is seeking employment to hire or if you are looking to connect with other surveyors in your location.
Now, I have finally come up with a solution!  
Head over to the Member Section of the site and you can now use the &quot;Member Quick View&quot; Feature.

                    <span>Building Information Modeling (BIM) is rising as an innovative way to manage projects, BIM expedites collaboration within stakeholders, which will lead to improved profitability, reduced costs, better time management, and improved client relationship. BIM not only allows design and construction teams to work more efficiently, but it allows them to obtain the data they generate during the process to gain from operational and maintenance activities. 
The global AEC industry must look for intelligent, productive, and progressive ways to design and build not just as a means to keep up with global demand but to help create spaces that are smarter and more flexible.
Cost and time restrictions, a scarcity of trained individuals with a comprehensive understanding of BIM, and the infrastructure and technology required for these services are all major issues for many businesses. When in-house services become unmanageable, outsourcing BIM services, especially Revit model development and family creation, makes sense.
Here are some advantages associates with CAD Outsourcing services
• Cost-Benefit
• Access to global talent
• Scalability
• Quicker Turn-Around Time
• 24-hour work cycle
• Integration with offsite team
• Zero Setup cost 
• Focus on core competency

                    <span>Good night
 
Unfortunately the UPS carrier Lost a box in the United States With Leica Robotic Tcrp 1203+ R400 with CS15 equipment ( Serials :
TCRP: 4824170
CS15: 5892231
I&#x27;ve registered them as Stolen. Unfortunately I did not take out insurance either and as such from 6150 usd I received about 150 usd refund.  
I don&#x27;t understand how they lose a rig without leaving a trail between texas and kentucky. How is it possible? neither invoice nor proof of payment was sufficient to receive further compensation.
 

Any suggestion?</span>

                    <span>An flood elevation certificate is a document issued by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that shows important features of your property like its location, flood zone, building characteristics, and elevation of its lowest floor. An Elevation Certificate is an actual field survey by a licensed professional surveyor. The elevation compares house and building elevations to the local flood elevation as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. An Elevation Certificate is a multi-page form that is completed by a licensed flood elevation certificate surveyors or engineer that determines the exact point at which your home or building is susceptible to flooding.

When you request a certificate, the surveyor comes to your home or building and notes the structure, size, construction restrictions, floors, and elevation of the lowest grade floor of the building. They then share this information with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and it is used to determine your insurance premium rate and/or ensure that your home or building is in compliance with local floodplain management ordinances.</span>

                    <span>Add Your USA Surveying Company to the Directory
One of the recent trends which seems to envelope USA Based surveying companies is becoming longer than usual waiting times to have a survey performed.  When we are more transparent about the current workload locally, they public will feel more informed and in turn, work with your time constraints.  One of the ways that we are trying to help surveying companies convey these wait times to the public is to provide a search engine optimized surveying company directory where they can create a surveying company listing which can be edited on the fly without having to edit your website or calling your webmaster.  Simply make a post here and in the post body, tell the public about your current normal wait.  When things change, simply edit your listing which you control.   There is no charge to be added to this directory...it was built to for you to use and its incredibly simple to use.

If you want to help make this better, you might consider donating toward the upcoming Real Estate Agents App which aggregates Land Surveyors Near Them for referrals and waittimes when recommending a local land surveyor.

                    <span>hi all, looking for some help...
Anyway, im having some really weird issue with one of our TS16s using captivate here

If I do my resection using autosetup ( our usual way ) it does the resection just fine, then when I go into measure or forward station, the jigger appears to be shooting distances backwards. As if the hz circle adds 180 degrees or the distance is set to negative? ( sorry only way I could think its doing it ) 

However, if I do the resection using standard setup( where i nominate each target ) , it shoots the distance just fine.

 
Any ideas why its doing this?</span>
