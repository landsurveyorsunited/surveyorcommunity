          "description": "Building Information Modeling (BIM) is rising as an innovative way to manage projects, BIM expedites collaboration within stakeholders, which will lead to improved profitability, reduced costs, better time management, and improved client relationship. BIM not only allows design and construction teams to work more efficiently, but it allows them to obtain the data they generate during the process to gain from operational and maintenance activities. \nThe global AEC industry must look for intelligent, productive, and progressive ways to design and build not just as a means to keep up with global demand but to help create spaces that are smarter and more flexible.\nCost and time restrictions, a scarcity of trained individuals with a comprehensive understanding of BIM, and the infrastructure and technology required for these services are all major issues for many businesses. When in-house services become unmanageable, outsourcing BIM services, especially Revit model development and family creation, makes sense.\nHere are some advantages associates with CAD Outsourcing services\n• Cost-Benefit\n• Access to global talent\n• Scalability\n• Quicker Turn-Around Time\n• 24-hour work cycle\n• Integration with offsite team\n• Zero Setup cost \n• Focus on core competency\nINDOVANCE Inc delivers a full range of BIM modeling projects. We work on parametric family creation, model creation for all LOD (Level of Detail), 4D, 5D, and 6D support, and model phasing, as well. We also provide complete support for CAD to BIM, point cloud to BIM conversions, and PDF to BIM conversions.\nGO BIG with BIM with a Specialized CAD Partner",

An Elevation Certificate is an actual field survey by a licensed professional surveyor. The elevation compares house and building elevations to the local flood elevation as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. An Elevation Certificate is a multi-page form that is completed by a licensed flood elevation certificate surveyors or engineer that determines the exact point at which your home or building is susceptible to flooding.\n\nWhen you request a certificate, the surveyor comes to your home or building and notes the structure, size, construction restrictions, floors, and elevation of the lowest grade floor of the building. They then share this information with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and it is used to determine your insurance premium rate and/or ensure that your home or building is in compliance with local floodplain management ordinances.",
