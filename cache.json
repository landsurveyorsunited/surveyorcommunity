          "description": "Airborne Electromagnetic (AEM) Remote Sensing – is a kind of remote sensing method to collect extensive volumes of data from aircraft. Primary purpose is to execute geophysical mapping in fast & cost-effective way which can cover large geographical areas. No need for new drilling on ground access. By using 3D modelling and visualization software, the quick turnaround subsurface mapping would be possible. The procedure is to involve a small airplane or UAV towing a sensor loop for about 30meters above the surface. It will generate an electromagnetic signal transmitted into the earth based on the subsurface properties and creating a secondary field measured from the aircraft. The data will be processed to estimate subsurface electrical properties that would help geoscientists establish the nature of the subsurface.",

          "description": "230 years ago, on the 21 June 1791, the Board of Ordnance was founded in order to survey the southern coast of England to help protect Britain from possible French invasion. 230 years later the Board of Ordnance is still going strong, although these days it goes by the name Ordnance Survey. \nTo celebrate its 230th birthday the Ordnance Survey has released Ordnance Survey Mapping Through the Centuries, an Esri story map which both recounts the history of Britain's national mapping agency and also allows you to explore some of its celebrated maps. These maps include the Board of Ordnance's very first map of Kent and the southern coast of England closest to France.\nThe Ordnance Survey Mapping Through the Centuries story map also explores the history of mapping over the last two hundred years and the technological changes in cartography during that time (from trig pillars to orbiting satellites)\n\nDuring lockdown I have had a lot of fun exploring historical Ordnance Survey maps. In particular I have used old Ordnance Survey maps to explore how my neighborhood has developed and changed over the last 150 years.Using vintage Ordnance Survey maps has given me a far greater understanding of how my neighborhood has changed over the last two hundred years and also helped make my local walks far more interesting.\nThe National Library of Scotland's Ordnance Survey Map Finder is a great way to find and view vintage Ordnance Survey map of British towns and cities. Using the library's online map you can find old Ordnance Survey maps dating back as far as the 1860s. By exploring your neighborhood on these historical maps you can learn a lot about how an area has developed over time and about some of the local historical landmarks and buildings which have been replaced by more modern developments.",

          "description": "The Federal Aviation Authority receives over 100 reports a month of unauthorized unmanned aircraft (UAS). Flying drones around aircraft and airports is both dangerous and illegal. Which is why there is mounting concern over the dramatic increase in incidents involving authorized drones over the last two years.\nUAV Geography's Map of Drone Incidents plots the location of all the UAS sighting reports made to the FAA by pilots, citizens and law enforcement officers. The red markers on the map indicate the location of sightings of unauthorized drones. You can click on these markings to read the actual sighting report.\n\nIf you want to fly a drone then you should bookmark the B4UFLY interactive map. The B4UFLY map shows you where you can and can't fly your drone. The map provides clear status indicators which show you where it is safe to fly or not. For example the map shows that you cannot fly in the Special Flight Rules Area around Washington, DC.\nIf you are flying a drone outside the United States then you might want to bookmark the Fly Safe Geo Zone Map which provides a guide to where drone flying may raise concerns and where it is restricted around the world.",

          "description": "Google’s Open Buildings is a new open dataset containing the location and geometry of 516 million buildings across Africa.The data includes the polygon outline of each building, its size in square meters and a confidence score of it being a valid building.\nAnyone can download the full dataset of over 500,000,000 buildings or download smaller datasets for individual level 4 S2 cells. The full data can be downloaded in CSV format or the tile geometry and URLs in GeoJSON format. \n It is hoped that the data will help refine an understanding of where people live, helping authorities to identify where infrastructure and vital services are required. It is also hoped that the data will contribute to a better understanding of population density, help authorities plan emergency responses, help with the rollout of digital address systems, and help with national planning.\nThe buildings were detected from satellite imagery by AI. The building data in some areas may be more accurate than in others. These confidence differences can emerge for a number of reasons. For example geological or vegetation features may have been confused with built structures. In some areas the delineations between individual buildings may not be clear in the satellite imagery. Buildings which are the same colors as the surrounding environment or terrain may be difficult to identify. Also very small buildings may be difficult to determine at the satellite resolution.",

          "description": "Yesterday Mapbox announced that they were integrating the controversial global addressing system What3Words with their Mapbox Dash navigation system.This immediately led to a lot of people on Twitter to question why Mapbox don't just use the latitude and longitude geographic coordinate system. You know the coordinate system which Mapbox uses in its own mapping APIs. \nThe latitude and longitude system has the benefit of using two numbers instead of three words. It also has the advantage of being able to provide geographic accuracy to the molecular level - as explained in this xkcd strip. It is also completely free to use and universally accepted and understood.\n\nYesterday, completely incidentally, Vladimir Agafonkin released an Observable notebook which visualizes the accuracy of the latitude and longitude geographic coordinate system when using increasing numbers of decimal places. His Latitude and Longitude Precision visualization overlays a red square on top of a map to show the area of the world that a latitude and longitude number points to. \nUsing two numbers to 4 decimal places you get an address with roughly the same accuracy as what3words. However if you add more numbers to your latitude and longitude address you can get even greater accuracy. Use two numbers to 6 decimal places and you can point to any location on Earth that is about ten centimeters square in size. What's more if you cut and paste a latitude and longitude into the search box of any interactive map it will instantly show you the location with that latitude and longitude address.",

          "description": "Of all the ancient maps, this one was surely the most influential. As Jerry Brotton writes in A History of the World in 12 Maps, Claudius Ptolemy’s remarkably comprehensive Geography — completed around 150 A.D. — “would come to define mapmaking for the next two millennia.” It wasn’t a map in the standard format, but an eight-volume book that claimed to describe the entire known world according to mathematical principles, with longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates for various locations. It boasted an astonishing 8,000 place names, including regions as far flung as Iceland and China. As with the Peutinger Table, the originals are lost. Likewise, the oldest known version comes from 13th-century Byzantium, where scholars resurrected the map that would dominate and inform cartographic efforts for centuries to come.",

The 8-by-14-foot petroglyph stands among hundreds of thousands of others, likely created in the first millennium B.C. It’s many abstract symbols are supposed to depict buildings, fields and paths, among other things. Scholars disagree, though, on whether the map was meant as a portrayal of an actual geographical area, or only as a symbolic statement — about the relationship between its creators and their environment, for example.",

          "description": "The earliest known attempt to show the Earth in its entirety was the Imago Mundi, or Babylonian map of the world, thought to date to around 600 B.C. The city of Babylon itself figures as a large rectangle, bisected by another rectangle representing the Euphrates River. A few neighboring cities dot the area nearby, and surrounding them all is a ring labeled the “Salt-Sea.” Beyond this circular waterway lie eight islands inhabited by legendary beings. \n \nThe Imago Mundi is just one of many maps inscribed in the clay tablets of Mesopotamia. It seems to be unique, however, in its scope. “Most ancient clay maps are large-scale representations of small areas, showing irrigation, fields and, most surely, ownership,” John O. E. Clark writes in Maps that Changed the World. They are also quite precise. “In contrast,” Assyriologist Wayne Horowitz writes, “the relative size and location of many of the features on the World Map seem preposterous.” But for its purpose — to mythologize, not to settle land disputes — it probably served just fine.",
