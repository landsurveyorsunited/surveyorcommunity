          "description": "Almost every manufactured object in the world today starts out as a three-dimensional computer model. The industry as a whole transitioned from 2D drawing to 3D solid modeling, enabling designers and manufacturers a more efficient and speedier means to make design modifications ‚Äî as well as a more accurate way to see products in a real-world setting.\nTo stay ahead of the curve in the highly competitive medical equipment services, OEMs must utilize all available resources, both in-house and offshore. For years, many equipment companies have reaped the benefits of outsourcing design & drafting services. Upstream functions, such as product design and development, have just recently been a prominent component of the outsourcing trend. OEMs are discovering that they can obtain various advantages by leveraging external engineering skills without endangering trade secrets or intellectual property (IP).\nHowever, to establish whether outsourcing product design and development is a strategic match for a company, numerous variables must be addressed.\nINDOVANCE strives to give clients the Assurance and Confidence they need to make the best strategic decisions for sustainable and safe design solutions, enhanced visualization and forecasting capabilities, easy maintenance and remodeling, compliance with international codes and standards, high-quality deliverables with cost-benefits and quick turnarounds, and easy integration for increased control over the equipment design process.\nBenefits of Outsourcing Medical Equipment Design Services.

          "description": "Airborne Electromagnetic (AEM) Remote Sensing ‚Äì is a kind of remote sensing method to collect extensive volumes of data from aircraft. Primary purpose is to execute geophysical mapping in fast & cost-effective way which can cover large geographical areas. No need for new drilling on ground access. By using 3D modelling and visualization software, the quick turnaround subsurface mapping would be possible. The procedure is to involve a small airplane or UAV towing a sensor loop for about 30meters above the surface. It will generate an electromagnetic signal transmitted into the earth based on the subsurface properties and creating a secondary field measured from the aircraft. The data will be processed to estimate subsurface electrical properties that would help geoscientists establish the nature of the subsurface.",

It boasted an astonishing 8,000 place names, including regions as far flung as Iceland and China. As with the Peutinger Table, the originals are lost.

          "description": "The earliest known attempt to show the Earth in its entirety was the¬†Imago Mundi, or Babylonian map of the world, thought to date to around 600 B.C. The city of Babylon itself figures as a large rectangle, bisected by another rectangle representing the Euphrates River. A few neighboring cities dot the area nearby, and surrounding them all is a ring labeled the ‚ÄúSalt-Sea.‚Äù Beyond this circular waterway lie eight islands inhabited by legendary beings.¬†\n¬†\nThe Imago Mundi is just one of many maps inscribed in the clay tablets of Mesopotamia. It seems to be unique, however, in its scope. ‚ÄúMost ancient clay maps are large-scale representations of small areas, showing irrigation, fields and, most surely, ownership,‚Äù John O. E. Clark writes in¬†Maps that Changed the World. They are also quite precise. ‚ÄúIn contrast,‚Äù¬†Assyriologist Wayne Horowitz writes, ‚Äúthe relative size and location of many of the features on the World Map seem preposterous.‚Äù But for its purpose ‚Äî to mythologize, not to settle land disputes ‚Äî it probably served just fine.",

          "description": "BIM automates core processes for quantity surveyors in the preconstruction stage by reinforcing the 3D BIM model with material and component cost estimates, model-based BOMs, and scheduling.\nThe role of a Quantity Surveyor in the construction industry carries great importance for AEC firms and clients. The quantity surveying practice requires being in charge of calculating building material quantity and finances within required deadlines, which is a crucial responsibility. Taking the role of a cost consultant to generate a Bill of Quantities (BOQ‚Äôs) from 2D drawings can be tedious and error-ridden.\nAdopting Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology helps quantity surveyors to boost efficiency and business through cost and time savings and improved coordination through accurate informa‚Ä¶",
