        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Airborne Electromagnetic (AEM) Remote Sensing – is a kind of remote sensing method to collect extensive volumes of data from aircraft. Primary purpose is to execute geophysical mapping in fast & cost-effective way which can cover large geographical areas. No need for new drilling on ground access. By using 3D modelling and visualization software, the quick turnaround subsurface mapping would be possible. The procedure is to involve a small airplane or UAV towing a sensor loop for about 30meters above the surface. It will generate an electromagnetic signal transmitted into the earth based on the subsurface properties and creating a secondary field measured from the aircraft. The data will be processed to estimate subsurface electrical properties that would help geoscientists establish the nature of the subsurface.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of all the ancient maps, this one was surely the most influential. As Jerry Brotton writes in A History of the World in 12 Maps, Claudius Ptolemy’s remarkably comprehensive Geography — completed around 150 A.D. — “would come to define mapmaking for the next two millennia.” It wasn’t a map in the standard format, but an eight-volume book that claimed to describe the entire known world according to mathematical principles, with longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates for various locations. It boasted an astonishing 8,000 place names, including regions as far flung as Iceland and China. As with the Peutinger Table, the originals are lost. Likewise, the oldest known version comes from 13th-century Byzantium, where scholars resurrected the map that would dominate and inform cartographic efforts for centuries to come.]]></summary>

The 8-by-14-foot petroglyph stands among hundreds of thousands of others, likely created in the first millennium B.C. It’s many abstract symbols are supposed to depict buildings, fields and paths, among other things. Scholars disagree, though, on whether the map was meant as a portrayal of an actual geographical area, or only as a symbolic statement — about the relationship between its creators and their environment, for example.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The earliest known attempt to show the Earth in its entirety was the Imago Mundi, or Babylonian map of the world, thought to date to around 600 B.C. The city of Babylon itself figures as a large rectangle, bisected by another rectangle representing the Euphrates River. A few neighboring cities dot the area nearby, and surrounding them all is a ring labeled the “Salt-Sea.” Beyond this circular waterway lie eight islands inhabited by legendary beings. 
 
The Imago Mundi is just one of many maps inscribed in the clay tablets of Mesopotamia. It seems to be unique, however, in its scope. “Most ancient clay maps are large-scale representations of small areas, showing irrigation, fields and, most surely, ownership,” John O. E. Clark writes in Maps that Changed the World. They are also quite precise. “In contrast,” Assyriologist Wayne Horowitz writes, “the relative size and location of many of the features on the World Map seem preposterous.” But for its purpose — to mythologize, not to settle land disputes — it probably served just fine.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building Information Modeling (BIM) is rising as an innovative way to manage projects, BIM expedites collaboration within stakeholders, which will lead to improved profitability, reduced costs, better time management, and improved client relationship. BIM not only allows design and construction teams to work more efficiently, but it allows them to obtain the data they generate during the process to gain from operational and maintenance activities. 
The global AEC industry must look for intelligent, productive, and progressive ways to design and build not just as a means to keep up with global demand but to help create spaces that are smarter and more flexible.
Cost and time restrictions, a scarcity of trained individuals with a comprehensive understanding of BIM, and the infrastructure and technology required for these services are all major issues for many businesses. When in-house services become unmanageable, outsourcing BIM services, especially Revit model development and family creation, makes sense.
Here are some advantages associates with CAD Outsourcing services
• Cost-Benefit
• Access to global talent
• Scalability
• Quicker Turn-Around Time
• 24-hour work cycle
• Integration with offsite team
• Zero Setup cost 
• Focus on core competency
INDOVANCE Inc delivers a full range of BIM modeling projects. We work on parametric family creation, model creation for all LOD (Level of Detail), 4D, 5D, and 6D support, and model phasing, as well. We also provide complete support for CAD to BIM, point cloud to BIM conversions, and PDF to BIM conversions.
